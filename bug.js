This React Native bug arises when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and improper key extraction.  The key prop in FlatList is crucial for efficient rendering and avoiding unexpected behavior.  If keys aren't unique and consistent, React Native might reuse existing components inappropriately, resulting in incorrect data display, rendering glitches, or unexpected component behavior.  For instance, if you use index as the key, and the data array changes (items added or removed),  FlatList may not update correctly.  This can lead to stale data display or flickering UI elements.  The problem is often subtle and difficult to debug, manifesting as random updates or missing elements.
